# This file is for local development environment variables.
# DO NOT COMMIT THIS FILE WITH PRODUCTION SECRETS.
# Secrets for production should be managed via Google Cloud Secret Manager
# and injected into your Google Cloud Run service as environment variables.

# Example (replace with your actual local development values if needed):
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-dev-project-id"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-dev-api-key"
# ... other local dev variables

# For Firebase Admin SDK in local development, you can use:
# 1. FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_CONFIG_PATH=path/to/your/local_service_account_key.json
# OR
# 2. FIREBASE_ADMIN_SDK_CONFIG_JSON_STRING='{ "type": "service_account", "project_id": "...", ... }' (paste the content of your service account JSON here as a single line string)

# Nodemailer (local development)
# GMAIL_EMAIL="your-dev-gmail-address@gmail.com"
